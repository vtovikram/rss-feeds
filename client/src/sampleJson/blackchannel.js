But we won’t be gone.</h4><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/216/1*l1rwI8JqPwqroFjU9Xbqfw.png" /></figure><p>Dear Backchannel readers,</p><p>Steven here. First, the news: Starting with the new year, Backchannel will be fully integrated into <a href="https://medium.com/u/ecdcb63e1a76">WIRED</a>. While this means that there won’t be a weekly drop of Backchannel stories and columns — and we won’t be producing them from solely within a five-person unit — you’ll be still seeing those stories and reading the same writers who produced them when you visit the WIRED site. In fact, Backchannel will live on in the form of a new section on wired.com, which will launch in the coming weeks. More on that to come.</p><p>In the meantime, you will still be able to read stories from <a href="https://medium.com/u/9eda8914b544">Jessi Hempel</a> and me on<a href="http://wired.com/"> wired.com</a>, and also in the print edition (though I will be writing less this year because of a book leave). Backchannel editors <a href="https://medium.com/u/bc1e3e60af88">Sandra Upson</a> and <a href="https://medium.com/u/5a217bc1e95b">Alexis Sobel Fitts</a> will transfer their skills to wired.com, and our associate editor <a href="https://medium.com/u/98aaa0cfb4be">Miranda Katz</a> will become a web producer for the site. All of us are excited to join the WIRED family, and we may even convince our new colleagues to run some meetings in the holocratic style we learned at Medium.</p><p>For those of you who follow Backchannel, this news probably won’t be a shock. Since we moved to the WIRED platform last June, it’s been clear that many — if not all — of our stories would have been appropriate for WIRED, and in some cases vice versa. It turns out that our vision of the tech world is pretty close to that of WIRED’s new editor, <a href="https://medium.com/u/e66076508d37">Nicholas Thompson</a>. It simply made sense to join forces.</p><p>Now, some personal notes. The three-plus years since I left WIRED to start Backchannel on Medium have been the most gratifying of my career. I loved working with a small team of smart editors and writers to produce high quality stories that we hoped might raise the bar of tech journalism. (Also, during our Medium years, I got an amazing inside glimpse of life at a buzzy internet startup.) But I am also thrilled to be returning to WIRED, which has been a writing home for me since its beginning. (I wrote its <a href="https://www.wired.com/1993/02/crypto-rebels/">second cover story</a>, about cypherpunks and the crypto revolution that’s still in the news.) Though Backchannel is no longer a separate entity — and, yeah, I admit that’s bittersweet — I’m also proud that its DNA will productively mingle with the greatest tech magazine on the planet. Also, keeping the Backcha…e will very soon come a point where autonomous technology proves itself to be consistently safer on certain roads or in certain cities, and it would be a tragedy for the powers that be to neglect or hinder such a development simply because it requires owning up to a decision and jarring people loose from the routine which keeps them predictably tranquilized and non-participating.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*ohyycinH18fz98TCyUzVgQ.png" /></figure><p>Good grief. Let me regain my composure, because I haven’t gotten to the point of why the Infinite Trolley problem needs to be addressed.</p><p>What the Infinite Trolley does—as illustrated by our little math exercise above—is stage a scenario that forces you to realize there is currency serving as the building blocks for the things we value. Loosely put, our example depicted one human life as being worth 8 million units of currency, but its origin goes deeper than the mere convenience of transportation. And, even if you disagree entirely with the math and believe one human life is priceless, then the logic would follow that two human lives are doubly as priceless, and so you too make choices based on currency.</p><p>Why is this important? Because as autonomous vehicles have progressed, we’ve come to realize that we can engineer them to solve problems like the trolley dilemma, thanks to the speed and volume with which they can process and act on data. Moreover, the nature of the statement “we need self-driving cars to be perfect” is not only that we <em>can</em> engineer these cars to solve such problems, but that we <em>must</em>.</p><p>Trouble is, in order for self-driving cars to solve the problems, they need to have a grasp of said “currency” in order to work out the decisioning logic as situations present themselves. In short: they need a level of awareness we don’t have about ourselves.</p><p>Journalists citing the trolley problem have posed questions such as, “will a self-driving car decide in an emergency that it is best to kill the driver rather than kill a pregnant mother?” This is not the shocking wake-up call we are about to encounter. No, what you might find instead is that the autonomous grid chose to slaughter a raving lunatic dancing in the street because he was holding up traffic, and as such, was mathematically hurting society by way of the fact that his life is worth 500,000 units of currency, whereas the time and productivity lost by the thousands he is delaying amounts to 1,000,000 units of currency. Should we instead decide <em>not</em> to program self-driving vehicles with any logic more complex than, say, Isaac Asimov’s laws of robotics, we would likely find the entire autonomous grid grinding to a useless halt on a daily basis for the sake of saving a life. Such is the consequence of stopping the Infinite Trolley.</p><iframe src="https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2FAWJJnQybZlk%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DAWJJnQybZlk&amp;image=https%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FAWJJnQybZlk%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;key=d04bfffea46d4aeda930ec88cc64b87c&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=youtube" width="854" height="480" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"><a href="https://medium.com/media/fa9580e0f1b8af06430fa40d6221a054/href">https://medium.com/media/fa9580e0f1b8af06430fa40d6221a054/href</a></iframe><p>On some level, I believe many of us realize we are fast becoming inefficient parties in the face of artificial intelligence. Science fiction movies where the robots have “deemed us expendable” give many people cause for concern, fleeting as the thought might be. However, we may find out all too soon that autonomous cars will have been the first salvo fired off by robots in such a future. We program them to understand our values. They make decisions that reflect our values. The decisions frighten us. What does that mean?</p><p><a href="https://medium.com/@mitchturck/self-driving-cars-and-sound-cannons-an-indecent-proposal-43ebf99fafc">Read Part II here</a> for a practical approach to solving this problem, and chime in with your opinion.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*320_4I0lxbn5x3bx4XPI5Q.png" /></figure><p>Follow Backchannel: <a href="https://twitter.com/backchnnl"><em>Twitter</em></a><em> | </em><a href="https://www.facebook.com/pages/Backchannel/1488568504730671"><em>Facebook</em></a></p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=85f3d1730756" width="1" height="1"><hr><p><a href="https://medium.com/backchannel/reinventing-the-trolley-problem-85f3d1730756">A Self-Driving Car Might Decide You Should Die</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/backchannel">Backchannel</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>]]></content:encoded></item></channel></rss>'
